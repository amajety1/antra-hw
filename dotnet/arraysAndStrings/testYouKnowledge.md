1. Use String when working with small or immutable strings. Use StringBuilder when modifying strings repeatedly for better performance.
2. The base class is System.Array.
3. Use Array.Sort(array) to sort it.
4. Use the Length property to get the total number of elements.
5. No, System.Array stores elements of a single data type.
6. CopyTo() copies elements to an existing array. Clone() creates a new copy of the entire array.
